Description: *
Clearly communicate the vision, objectives, and technical implementation of your idea. Your abstract should be no longer than 250 words.
fi.plus aims to scale cross-border payments by tapping Stellar’s high-speed, low-cost network. We will expand from our initial Indian market into over 30 countries, focusing on corridors with large remittance flows. Using Stellar anchors (SEP-24/31), we plan to bridge local currencies to USD/EUR stablecoins, enabling instant transfers without users needing crypto knowledge. Stellar’s design makes it ideal for this: transactions settle in 3–5 seconds at just ~$0.000005 cost per operation, and built-in compliance controls (KYC, freeze, clawback) simplify regulation. Stablecoins on Stellar (like USDC and EURC) provide a stable store of value and liquidity. In short, our objective is to leverage Stellar’s global anchor ecosystem to onboard millions of users in emerging markets, reducing fees and friction in remittances. 

Additional Features that would be built: 
•	Reputation Engine to reduce fraud and build user trust across markets
•	Multi-currency & multi-lingual support for inclusivity and adoption

fi.plus is a remittance platform leveraging the Stellar blockchain to deliver low-cost, near-instant cross-border payments. Our core objective is to rapidly expand from India into 30+ high-remittance markets (e.g. Turkey, UAE, Nigeria, Brazil, Vietnam, Kenya, Philippines, EU) by integrating Stellar’s stablecoin rails and global anchor network. We have a functioning MVP supporting USDC and EURC stablecoin transfers. Key integrations (fiat on/off-ramps, KYC/AML, local banking) are in place, and we have processed over $200K in transactions on existing chains. With SCF funding, we will scale operations on Stellar – onboarding new anchors, enhancing compliance, and engaging users to drive adoption.
Progress & Traction to Date:
•	Product Launch: We have completed our MVP. Users can send and receive USDC and EURC stablecoins on Stellar, tapping into Circle’s global token supply. The platform feature multi-currency wallets, addressing the needs of currency exchange in real time.
•	Early Adoption: Over 500 early adopters (KYC-verified via Sumsub) have tested fi.plus in India and Nigeria. Feedback cycles are active: users have influenced UX improvements and prioritization of local language support.
•	Transaction Volume: To date, fi.plus has processed over $200,000 (USD-equivalent) in cross-border transactions (primarily between India, Nigeria, and EU) across available onramps. This validates product-market fit. We aim to migrate volume to Stellar to exploit its efficiencies (Yellow Card’s experience shows Stellar cuts costs dramatically).
•	Partner Integrations: We are integrating with local banks and payment rails. Notably, we connected Nigerian NGN bank accounts and partnered with crypto card providers (in the model of KAST, which enables Nigerians to spend stablecoins via Visa). These integrations make fi.plus usable by the unbanked, aligning with Stellar’s vision of financial inclusion.




Integrations & Compliance:
To ensure seamless fiat-to-crypto flows, fi.plus has integrated best-in-class services:
•	Onramp.money Gateway: We partnered with Onramp.money to support local currency purchases of crypto in dozens of countries. Onramp.money is live in India, Turkey, UAE, Vietnam, Nigeria, Brazil, EU, Kenya, and more – exactly our target markets. This lets users buy USDC/EURC with INR, NGN, EUR, etc., and vice versa, without leaving our app.
•	Bank & Payment Rails: We are connecting to traditional banking APIs (e.g. Nigeria’s funds settlement systems) and crypto-visa cards. Our platform supports transfers to bank accounts and cards denominated in local fiat or stablecoins. (For example, like KAST in Nigeria, our users can spend stablecoins globally via Visa networks.)
•	Stellar Anchor Standards: fi.plus implements Stellar’s SEP-24 and SEP-31 standards for deposit/withdraw and anchor-to-anchor transfers. This means our app’s wallet logic can plug into any compliant anchor. We will use the Stellar Polaris framework to expedite adding new on/off-ramps. By following these standards, we create a seamless remittance experience: fiat deposits go directly through our integrated anchors, and users need not understand the blockchain mechanics behind the scenes.

Technology Stack:
Our stack emphasizes security, scalability, and rapid development:
•	Backend: Built on a cloud-native microservices architecture (e.g. Node.js/Express or Python/Django APIs, Dockerized). Services handle user accounts, transaction processing, and integrations. Databases (PostgreSQL) and encrypted key vaults store data securely. We follow Node.js security best practices (e.g. OWASP guidelines) and regular audits.
•	Frontend: Cross-platform mobile apps (React Native or Flutter) deliver a smooth user experience in multiple languages. The UI connects to our backend APIs and the Stellar network via SDKs. We implemented wallet functionality carefully – private keys are encrypted on-device.
•	Blockchain Integration: We use Stellar’s official SDK to submit transactions. Our system monitors the Stellar ledger for confirmations (settlement in \~3 seconds) and leverages the built-in decentralized exchange to automatically swap stablecoins as needed. All fiat-to-stablecoin conversions adhere to regulatory controls.
•	Planned Enhancements: We are exploring Soroban smart contracts on Stellar for future features like programmable escrow or yield accounts, which could add value for users. However, our immediate focus is on reliable payment rails. We also plan to integrate additional anchors: for example, launching a EUR anchor (SEP-24) for SEPA payouts to Europe, or a KES anchor for Kenya. Polaris will allow us to stand up these anchors in weeks, unlocking new corridors swiftly.

Global Rollout Plan:
We will expand fi.plus in phases across prioritized markets:
1. Phase 1 (Q3–Q4 2025): Scale in India and Nigeria, deepening partnerships with INR and NGN anchors. Target diaspora corridors: India→Africa, Nigeria→Africa. Conduct marketing and user acquisition in tech hubs.
2. Phase 2 (2026): Enter Southeast Asia (Philippines, Vietnam) and MENA (UAE, Turkey). Leverage Onramp.money coverage and local anchor providers. Establish EUR and USD rails for EU transfers.
3. Phase 3 (2026+): Roll out in Brazil, Kenya, and broader Europe. Each launch will involve on-the-ground compliance work and local user support.

Throughout, we will partner with local Stellar anchors and fintechs (similar to how Yellow Card operates in Africa). Stellar’s anchor network already spans 180+ countries and supports 20+ fiat assets, so we can plug into existing liquidity wherever possible. By integrating our app with these anchors, fi.plus users will essentially “wallet-hop” across borders: depositing in one currency and receiving in another, all settled on Stellar. This global on-ramp/off-ramp strategy will give us immediate reach into new markets without building localized infrastructure from scratch.

User Engagement & Community:
fi.plus is committed to iterative, user-centered growth. We have an active user forum and in-app feedback channels. Early adopters have helped refine our UX (for example, simplifying KYC steps and adding local language support). We will continue beta testing in each new market, running surveys and user interviews to ensure our features solve real needs. Educational content (e.g. tutorial videos on stablecoins) and multilingual support will drive adoption. We will also engage the Stellar community via Discord and events to gather technical feedback and ensure alignment with ecosystem best practices. By demonstrating usage and gathering testimonials, we build momentum that appeals to SCF reviewers and the wider community.

Alignment with Stellar & SCF:
fi.plus exemplifies the core goals of the Stellar Community Fund: practical impact, robust technology, and growth. Our platform drives real financial inclusion by making remittances faster and cheaper for underserved users. We leverage Stellar’s unique strengths – anchors and stablecoins – in proven ways. Every design decision, from Polaris integration to cross-chain stablecoin support, is made to strengthen the Stellar ecosystem. With SCF support, we will accelerate our roadmap, add more anchors, and on-board tens of thousands of new users, boosting Stellar transaction volume and real-world usage.

Funding Request: We seek a SCF Build award (up to ~$150K) to execute the above plan. These funds will be allocated to engineering resources (expanding development team), compliance/legal support in new regions, and go-to-market activities (user education, partnerships). (A detailed budget can be provided.) By securing SCF backing, fi.plus will confidently scale on Stellar and deliver measurable results.

Sources: Stellar documentation and case studies affirm the suitability of Stellar for remittances. Onramp.money’s coverage validates our targeted markets. Our referenced sources and traction data demonstrate both the need and the readiness of our solution. We are prepared to collaborate closely with SDF and the Stellar community to refine our proposal further.

(It did not allow me to enter text in this section, so I entered this content in traction section) We are currently using internal analytics tools to monitor usage. These tools support product iteration and corridor validation. Once we scale with SCF support and complete additional security audits, we plan to make a public-facing dashboard showcasing Stellar-based remittance volume, corridor-level growth, and anchor integrations to increase ecosystem transparency and trust.

While fi.plus is still in the early stages of scaling on Stellar, we have already achieved significant product validation and user traction through our MVP and initial integrations:

Product Metrics:

•	$200,000+ in transaction volume processed across stablecoin corridors (USDC/EURC), validating product-market fit in key remittance flows (India ↔ EU, Nigeria ↔ EU).
•	500+ KYC-verified users, actively testing our MVP in India and Nigeria.
•	100+ community feedback responses collected during private testing, influencing improvements to UI/UX, onboarding, and local language features.

Technology & Integration Progress:

•	Full support for USDC/EURC stablecoin transfers on Stellar.
•	Integration with Onramp.money for fiat on-ramps across 10+ countries (IN, NG, TR, BR, KE, VN, EU, etc.).
•	Stellar SEP-24/SEP-31 compliant architecture using Polaris and the official Stellar SDK.

Market Readiness & Coverage:

•	Live in India and Nigeria; additional anchors planned for Europe, MENA, and Southeast Asia.
•	Partnered with banking APIs and Visa crypto card providers to enable fiat-to-crypto-to-fiat flows for the unbanked.
•	Target markets represent $600B+ in annual remittance flows (per World Bank 2023), with high crypto adoption rates.

Planned KPIs (Post-SCF Funding):

•	Transaction volume goal: $2M+ processed within 6 months.
•	User base goal:5,000+ active users across 5+ countries.
•	Anchor goal: 5 new Stellar-compliant fiat anchors integrated.
•	Community goal: Launch ambassador program and local education campaigns in 3 new regions.

These metrics demonstrate both momentum and a data-driven approach to scaling. With SCF support, we will capture and publish detailed analytics on-chain (via Stellar explorer) and off-chain (via usage dashboards), contributing transparently to the ecosystem.
