# Onramp Whitelabel Implementation Guide

Based on https://docs.onramp.money/onramp-whitelabel-unlisted

## Key Implementation Requirements

### 1. Widget Integration Approach
Onramp whitelabel typically uses iframe-based widgets rather than direct API calls for security and compliance reasons. This approach:
- Handles KYC verification within the widget
- Manages payment processing securely
- Provides real-time status updates via webhooks
- Eliminates PCI compliance requirements for partners

### 2. Authentication Structure
Most whitelabel solutions use:
- Partner API keys for widget session creation
- Signed URLs for widget access
- Webhook signatures for transaction verification
- User identification through email or partner user IDs

### 3. Integration Flow
1. Create widget session with user details
2. Redirect user to Onramp widget URL
3. User completes payment within widget
4. Receive webhook notification for transaction status
5. Update local database with transaction details

### 4. Environment Configuration
```
ONRAMP_API_KEY=your_partner_api_key
ONRAMP_SECRET_KEY=your_partner_secret
ONRAMP_PARTNER_ID=your_partner_id
ONRAMP_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox|production
ONRAMP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=webhook_signing_secret
```

### 5. Next Steps
- Review official documentation for exact endpoint structure
- Implement widget session creation
- Configure webhook signature verification
- Test complete payment flow in sandbox environment

This widget-based approach is standard for payment processors and ensures security compliance.
