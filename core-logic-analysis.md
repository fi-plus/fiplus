# fi.plus Core Logic Analysis

## Critical Logic Inconsistencies Found

### 1. Currency vs Stablecoin Mapping Issues
**Problem:** Currency codes don't match stablecoin assets consistently
- Dashboard shows: USD → USDC, EUR → EURC, but uses "GBPC", "INRC", "NGNC", "KESC"
- Real Stellar network only has: USDC (Circle), EURC (Circle), native stablecoins for other currencies don't exist
- Send money logic assumes 1:1 conversion but doesn't handle currency→stablecoin→currency conversion properly

### 2. Exchange Rate Calculation Conflicts
**Issues:**
- Dashboard: Hardcoded rate (83.12 for USD-INR)
- Send Money: Different rates in EXCHANGE_RATES object
- Add Money: No exchange rate logic for stablecoin conversion
- Cash Out: Missing conversion between stablecoins and local currencies

### 3. Wallet Balance Data Inconsistency
**Problems:**
- Dashboard: Shows USDC, EURC, XLM balances
- Add Money: Converts to "stablecoins" but doesn't update wallet balances
- Cash Out: References same balances but different asset mapping
- No connection between mock balances and actual Stellar network

### 4. User State Management Issues
**Conflicts:**
- KYC status in schema vs UI status tracking
- Stellar wallet creation flag vs actual wallet generation
- User authentication state vs wallet connection requirement

### 5. Transaction Flow Logic Gaps
**Problems:**
- Send Money: Creates transaction but doesn't update sender balance
- Add Money: Simulates payment but doesn't create transaction record
- Cash Out: Withdrawal doesn't reduce wallet balance
- History: Shows mock data not connected to actual transactions

### 6. Fee Calculation Inconsistencies
**Issues:**
- Dashboard: Shows $0.000005 XLM fee
- Send Money: Uses $0.000005 XLM fee
- Add Money: Shows percentage fees (0%, 0.5%, 2.9%)
- Cash Out: Different percentage fees (0.5%, 1%, 2%)
- No unified fee structure

### 7. Recipient Experience Logic Flaws
**Problems:**
- SMS claim link flow assumes phone number format validation
- Push notification logic checks email format but sends to existing users
- New user wallet creation doesn't integrate with main user flow
- Claim page doesn't validate against real transactions

## Data Model Inconsistencies

### Schema vs Implementation Gaps
1. **Users table** has `stellarPublicKey` but UI doesn't generate/store real keys
2. **Transactions table** has comprehensive fields but UI creates incomplete records
3. **Wallets table** designed for multi-currency but UI assumes fixed assets
4. **Exchange rates table** exists but rates are hardcoded in components

### Authentication vs Authorization
- Protected routes check user existence but not wallet connection status
- KYC verification status stored in database but not enforced in transactions
- Stellar wallet creation flag exists but wallet connection still required

## Critical Business Logic Errors

### 1. Currency Conversion Chain
**Current:** USD amount → Display INR amount (fake conversion)
**Should be:** USD → USDC → Stellar DEX → Target stablecoin → Local currency

### 2. Balance Management
**Current:** Static mock balances never change
**Should be:** Real-time balance updates from Stellar network queries

### 3. Transaction Recording
**Current:** UI shows success but no database record created
**Should be:** Complete transaction lifecycle with database persistence

### 4. Real-time Data
**Current:** All rates, balances, and statuses are hardcoded
**Should be:** Live data from Stellar network and exchange APIs

## Contextual Flow Breaks

### Happy Path Inconsistencies
1. **Add Money:** Shows successful payment but balance doesn't update
2. **Send Money:** Completes transfer but recipient experience disconnected
3. **Cash Out:** Initiates withdrawal but no balance reduction
4. **KYC:** Updates status but doesn't unlock actual features

### Cross-Component Data Sharing
- Components use different currency lists and exchange rates
- Wallet balances exist in multiple places with different values
- User states managed inconsistently across pages

## Critical Fixes Needed

### Immediate Priority
1. Unify currency/stablecoin mapping across all components
2. Implement consistent exchange rate source
3. Connect wallet balance updates to transaction flows
4. Integrate real Stellar network queries (requires API keys)
5. Fix transaction recording to update database
6. Standardize fee calculation across all flows

### Architecture Issues
1. Remove mock data dependencies
2. Implement proper state management for balances
3. Create unified currency conversion service
4. Add real-time data synchronization
5. Fix authentication flow to properly handle wallet states

The application has excellent UI/UX but critical business logic inconsistencies that prevent real-world functionality.
