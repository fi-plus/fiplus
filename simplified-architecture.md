# Simplified Architecture with Onramp Integration

## Current Approach: Widget-Based Payment Processing

Since Onramp.money handles all blockchain complexity, our architecture simplifies to:

### User Flow
1. **Add Money**: User selects amount → Redirected to Onramp widget → Payment completed → Return to platform
2. **Send Money**: User enters recipient → Onramp processes conversion → Funds transferred
3. **Cash Out**: User requests withdrawal → Onramp handles crypto-to-fiat → Bank transfer completed

### Our Responsibilities
- User authentication and KYC data collection
- Payment UI and user experience
- Transaction history and receipts
- Webhook handling for status updates

### Onramp's Responsibilities
- Stellar wallet creation and management
- Blockchain transaction processing
- Crypto-to-fiat conversions
- Banking integrations
- Compliance and regulatory handling

## Implementation Focus

**Widget Integration**
- Embed Onramp payment widgets for all money operations
- Handle success/failure redirects
- Process webhook notifications for real-time status

**Database Records**
- Store transaction metadata and user preferences
- Link Onramp transaction IDs to our internal records
- Maintain audit trail for compliance

**User Experience**
- Seamless handoff to Onramp widgets
- Clear status updates and notifications
- Transaction history with Onramp data integration

This approach eliminates the need for direct Stellar SDK integration while providing a production-ready payment platform.
