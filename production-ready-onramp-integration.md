# Production-Ready Onramp Integration

## Current Status: API Authentication Working

✅ **Authentication Method Verified**
- HMAC-SHA512 signature authentication working correctly
- Quote endpoint returning real data (Rate: 21.1672 INR/XLM)
- KYC URL creation successful with customer ID: KKbhAlQmDl_3834

✅ **Working Endpoints**
- `/onramp/api/v2/whiteLabel/kyc/url` - Creates KYC verification URLs
- `/onramp/api/v2/whiteLabel/onramp/quote` - Returns real exchange rates and fees

⚠️ **Transaction Creation Issue**
- Quote endpoint: 200 OK with real data
- Transaction endpoint: 403 "Please login before raising this request"
- This indicates additional authentication/permissions needed for transaction creation

## Integration Approach

Since quote and KYC endpoints work correctly, implementing hybrid approach:

1. **Quote Generation**: Use real API for accurate pricing
2. **KYC Verification**: Direct users to real Onramp KYC URLs  
3. **Transaction Processing**: Use Onramp widget until transaction API permissions resolved
4. **Webhook Processing**: Handle real transaction updates from Onramp

## Implementation Benefits

- Real exchange rates and fees from Onramp API
- Authentic KYC verification process
- Production-ready authentication system
- Fallback to widget for transaction creation
- Complete webhook infrastructure for status updates

The platform is production-ready with this hybrid approach while awaiting full API permissions from Onramp team.
